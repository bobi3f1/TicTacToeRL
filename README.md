# TicTacToeRL
Tic-Tac-Toe with Reinforcement Learning 🧠🎮
This repository features a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent implemented in Python. The RL agent is trained using the Q-learning algorithm to play optimally against a human opponent or another agent. The project leverages libraries like numpy and pandas for efficient board management and Q-value updates.

Features 🚀
Play Against the Agent: Test your skills by playing against the trained RL agent.
Train the Agent: Train the agent over multiple episodes to improve its performance.
Dynamic Exploration: Implements epsilon-greedy strategy with dynamic epsilon decay for balancing exploration and exploitation.
Save and Load Training Data: Persist the Q-table in a file (q_table.csv) for reuse across sessions.
Efficient Algorithms: Uses Python libraries (numpy, pandas) for optimized performance and structured Q-value management.
Installation 📦
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-rl.git
cd tic-tac-toe-rl
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python tictactoe_rl.py
How It Works ⚙️
Tic-Tac-Toe Game: A classic 3x3 grid game where two players compete to align three markers in a row, column, or diagonal.
Reinforcement Learning:
Q-learning Algorithm: The agent learns an optimal policy by interacting with the environment, updating Q-values based on rewards.
Epsilon-Greedy Strategy: Balances exploration (trying new moves) and exploitation (choosing the best-known move).
Reward System:
Win: +1
Draw: +0.5
Loss: -1
Usage 🎮
Train the Agent:

Select the "Train the agent" option in the menu.
Specify the number of training episodes.
The Q-table is updated and saved automatically after training.
Play Against the Agent:

Select the "Play against the agent" option in the menu.
Make your move by entering a number (0-8) corresponding to the grid position.
The agent plays as X and you play as O.
Exit the Game:

Select the "Exit" option to close the program.
File Structure 📂
tictactoe_rl.py: Main script for training, playing, and managing the RL agent.
q_table.csv: Stores the Q-table (state-action values) for reuse across sessions.
Future Enhancements 🌟
Add a GUI using libraries like tkinter or PyQt.
Implement Deep Q-Learning for more complex environments.
Enable multiplayer and agent-vs-agent modes.
